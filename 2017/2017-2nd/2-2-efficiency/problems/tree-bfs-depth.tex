\section{BFS on Tree (UD Problem 4.3)}

Write algorithms that solve the following problems by performing \emph{breadth-first traversals} of the given trees. 
You may assume the availability of a queue $Q$. 
The operations on $Q$ include adding an item to the rear, 
retrieving and removing an item from the front, and testing $Q$ for emptiness.
    
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
  \item Given a tree $T$ whose nodes contain integers, 
    print a list consisting of the sum of contents of nodes at depth 0, 
    the sum of contents of nodes at depth 1, etc.
  \item Given a tree $T$, find the depth $K$ with the maximal number of nodes in $T$. 
    If there are several such $K$s, return their maximum.
\end{enumerate}
