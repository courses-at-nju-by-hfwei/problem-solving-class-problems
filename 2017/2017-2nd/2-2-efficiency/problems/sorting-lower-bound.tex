\section{Lower Bound for Comparison-based Sorting (UD Problem 6.13)}

Prove a lower bound of $O(n \lg n)$ on the time complexity of any comparison-based sorting algorithm.

\subsection{Understanding the Problem}

First of all, this problem is \emph{flawed}, if not wrong.
\marginnote{I am not surprised at all if you are good at proving something wrong to be a theorem.}
It should be $\Omega(n \lg n)$, instead of $O(n \lg n)$.

{\bf Comparison-based Sorting.}

\begin{itemize}
  \item We only consider the sorting algorithms in which
    \marginnote{Counting sort, radix sort, or bucket sort is not a comparison-based sorting algorithm.}
    comparison is the only way to obtain order information between elements; and
  \item Comparisons of elements are the critical operations we care about.
    \marginnote{In \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancake\_sorting}{pancake sorting}, 
    we are interested in the minimum number of flips (or technically, prefix reversals).\cite{Gates:DM1979}}
\end{itemize}

{\bf Time complexity $O(n \lg n)$.} Algorithms on the inputs of size $n$.
